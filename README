*** One Core, Many Apps
I like to use a centralized CakePhp core library for multiple projects on
my development server.  In the source CakePhp distribution, the "core" library
would be the one found in the "cake" directory (with the files basics.php,
bootstrap.php, and dispatcher.php in it).  This library generally remains
constant between projects.

The app directory is the place where most the customization takes place and I
copy that to a projects own directory.  I also move the cake webroot directory
out of the app directory and on to the same level as the app directory.

So on my linux server, I will have the core cake and various project directories
set up something like this:

/var/www/
    cake_core/          <-- "cake" dir from cake source
    project1/
        app/            <-- "app" dir from cake source
        webroot/        <-- this is within "app" in the source
            index.php   <-- edit path settings in this file
    project2/
        app/
        webroot/
            index.php

Then I configure the DocumentRoot in apache2 config file for each project to
point to the webroot dir.

To make this work, it will be necessary to edit the path settings in the webroot
index.php file.  In this distribution, I add three variables in an attempt
to make this as simple and obvious as possible: $CakePhpAppDirParent,
$CakePhpAppDirName, $CakePhpCoreDir.

For project1 above, the settings would be as follows:

$CakePhpAppDirParent = dirname(dirname(__FILE__));
$CakePhpAppDirName = 'app';
$CakePhpCoreDir = dirname($CakePhpAppDirParent) . DS . 'cake_core';

See webroot/index.php here for details.
