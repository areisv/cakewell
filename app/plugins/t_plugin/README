t_plugin is provided as a plugin template for CakePhp.  To create a real
functional plugin, copy this directory and give it a new name.  You can
then stub out your plugin by replacing t_plugin in file names and within
the files by replacing t_plugin with your plugin name.

So, for example, if you were going to create a "killer" plugin,
t_plugin_app_model.php would be renamed killer_app_mod.php and the class
renamed KllerAppModel.
