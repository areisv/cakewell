    <p>The view for this url is entirely static and has no style sheets
       associated with it.</p>

    <p>It does require that the routes config file be updated to include:<br />
       <tt>Router::connect('/journal/*', array('controller' => 'journal',
           'action' => 'index'));</tt></p>
